## ü§ñ Introduction

Kalrav is a web-based application equipped with a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for continuous mental health monitoring. It enables patients to regularly log their thoughts, feelings, and experiences, providing immediate responses and generating mental health insights. The application aims to support mental health professionals in tracking patient progress and ensuring timely interventions when necessary.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vite, React.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** NodeJS, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **AI/NLP:** Python, various NLP libraries and tools

## üîã Features

1. **Patient Interface:**

   - Chat interface for patients to log their thoughts, feelings, and experiences in text form.
   - Immediate responses to provide comfort.
   - Automatic generation of mental health insights and periodic progress reports.

2. **Backend NLP Model:**

   - **Polarity Detection:** Identifies emotional polarity (positive, neutral, or negative) and tracks sentiment trends over time.
   - **Keyword Extraction (NER):** Extracts key mental health-related phrases or entities, providing insights into recurring or significant concerns.
   - **Concern Classification:** Categorizes concerns into predefined mental health issues such as Anxiety, Depression, Stress, Insomnia, or Eating Disorders.
   - **Intensity Scoring:** Assigns a severity score (1-10) based on linguistic and contextual cues, indicating the seriousness of the user‚Äôs concerns.
   - **Timeline-Based Sentiment Shift Analysis:** Evaluates how sentiment, concerns, and intensity have evolved over a specified time period.

3. **Therapist Dashboard:**

   - Web-based admin interface for mental health professionals.
   - View patient reports containing time-series graphs, sentiment trends, and detailed analysis of the patient‚Äôs mental state.
   - Download reports in standardized formats (e.g., PDF) for further review.
   - Monitor patients' ongoing mental health and their progress or regression over time.

4. **Emergency Alert System:**
   - Threshold-based alert mechanism.
   - If the intensity score exceeds a critical level, the system triggers an alert to the therapist and emergency contacts designated by the patient.
   - Ensures timely intervention in situations involving potential self-harm or mental health crises.
